#Hello World!
Welcome to my blog. This blog will be used to document the creation of <strong>Due Dates</strong> (working title) a new website that will be used to
crowdsource project and homework deadlines for students all over the US. Our
plan is to trial the website with LAsA and then aisd, before implementing a 
robust system to allow it to scale to any size. 
#Things we did in Week 1.
	Week 1 was marked by setting up most of the backend features for the site. Here they are, listed in order of completion.
### Node.js Server Setup
	To make a node app... you have to setup the node app! The first thing we investigated was the basics of node, and how to setup, start, and stop a basic node server. We settled on using [Koding](http://koding.com) for our development prototyping and [Github](http://github.com) to host our source code. At the recommendation of others, we settled on using [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/), a version of node expressly built for web applications.
### Registration
	The first task to tackle after running a server, is to get users onto it. Some of us worked on the front end here, implementing html in conjunction with [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). Meanwhile, the other half of the group, me included, worked on getting a backend mysql server setup, which involved creation of a database with a table and fields, as well as learning how to implement a connection to mysql through node (we acomplished this with the fantastic [node-mysql](https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql)). After this was all setup, we implemented password hashing for security using [node-password-hash](https://github.com/davidwood/node-password-hash).
### Login
	Essentially the reverse of registration, instead of <em> writing to </em> the database, we now had to learn how to pull from the database. Involved in this process also was figuring out how to compare a given password's hash to the hash pulled from the database.
### Hosting
	The final thing I acomplished this week outside of class was setting up the dev->production workflow. I wrote code to detect if the app is running on the production server of our site, hosted on [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/), and adjust server settings accordingly. Openshift is a pretty great host for both the node app and mysql db, with a bunch of neat features. Openshift hosts your app with a git repo, whenever you push to the repo it takes down your app and rebuilds it with the new version. To implement this, I setup a two remote system on git. One points to Github, one to Openshift. Essentially, we can use Github/Koding for all of development, and whenever we want to push the current build to live, I can just type 
	<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="git">git push origin openshift</code></pre></div>
	and the openshift server will instantly update. Finally, I pointed the Openshift host to my domain, you can now find our project with everything we have acomplished so far (which is just login/registration) at [http://duedates.ehsandev.com](http://duedates.ehsandev.com).
