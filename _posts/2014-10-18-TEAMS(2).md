#Since Last time
This week was short, but we worked a bit on the scraping for the new APP, anticipating the release of [Android Lollipop](http://www.android.com/versions/lollipop-5-0/) the latest operating system for Android bringing a whole new design language (called Material Design) to the platform.
##Scraping TEAMS
Without getting into too many specifics, scraping involves emulating how a normal person uses a browser. Ideally, scraping allows you to "see" (as in download html) of any page just as a user would. Our team then built a custom parsing library that takes the html and extracts variables from it's tables. In this way, we can convert what someone sees on a screen in a browser such as Chrome to the (much faster process) of requesting a page from a server, and simply parsing the text we get back. The scraper does not execute any javascript or parse any css on the page, thus making it far faster at retrieving pages with a much lower footprint.
