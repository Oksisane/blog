#Emailing
This week I worked on email authentication. Through use of a gmail account and smpt along with the node extension node-mailer we were able to setup email registration. Using the node crypto library we generated random hashes which are stored in a database along with the username they correspond to. When the registration link is clicked the user is flagged as active and the hash is deleted from the table. This is an effective way to prevent spamming of new user accounts!
