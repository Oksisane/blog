#Learning HTML/CSS
##Overview
I think that there were both pros and cons to the way we learned html/css over the course of the first 6 weeks. As someone who already knows css/html basics, I found the labs we completed a bit boring and redundant, but they did effectivly reinforce the concepts learned in the lab for others. While I was exempt from it, I do not think that the Code Avengers practice was very helpful for the class as a whole. What little of the Code Avengers work I did do I found repetitive and picky, in certain cases the site did not accept my perfectly correct answers to questions because they had to be formated in a certain way and deducted "points" which translated into a lower score on the code avengers. 
##The Final Project
The Stanford projects that served as a sort of "culmination" of the html/css unit was a good practice, but a bit of a pointless exercise in that the result produced was useless. I think a better final project for html/css would be something the class could be excited to have completed-such as a personal site. The second project involving tabs also used extremely complex css to properly complete, which, even as it was not intended, was a bit annoying.
